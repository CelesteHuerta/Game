  <!--Music through memories, ripped out of faith and with courage. Don't fear his questions, answer and you'll be in safe hands. Fear is just what he wants... Your screams are all that he wants. Every night, he'll haunt in your dreams, hunting for victims; awake and asleep. You can run and hide, but never escape, remember my children, do not run away... Do not run away... Remember the good times, the cruel ones and the pain, I remember everything, pure, wholesome, sane. Try and escape and you'll see what's next. Remember my children, everything is the same... here in my humble domain... -->
