  <!--Log 13: A Draconequues, perhaps the most difficult to understand being of the cosmos. With the body of all assorted creatures, their existence is partially why I began my experiments. Namely Subjects 2D-MX and D3-AD. But no matter what I do, no matter how many animals I have sacrificed to make my children... I cannot make one!! My test subjects almost never live past insession and if I manage to connect the nerves and tissue together, they never live past an hour. Even with my magic… It’s incredible that I, a King with powers beyond the universe cannot create something I was destined to do… I was meant to bring life to wastelands. I was meant to be great… I need to make my parents pleased… make them proud. Smile down upon me from the dark matter and stars they have become. Mother always told me to never give up on hope… I must always have hope.  -->
