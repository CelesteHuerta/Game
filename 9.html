<!--Afterall, there are many monsters who cannot be seen, yet are there to harm. Mr. Daemonium has become invisible to the average bystander, and can only be seen by the one he protects, the one he shares a bond with and in most cases, it is someone I am accustomed to, for you see, only a handful of equines know of my projects… What better way to serve your purpose than to defend those who had been working beside you? For now, I keep hin trapped in a crystal that rests in my regal chestplate. I would have him watch over my most beloved Vanth, but I fear what he might see. I fear what dreams he will implant in her mind while she slumbers. I cannot have him interrupt her soft singing while she rests… Of course, Mr. Daemonium no longer has memory of what he once was or what he is now… It feels wrong to name him anything else though... -->
