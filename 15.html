  -The Whisperer can’t be seen in the Mortal Realm, or in simpler words, our reality: our world. The Whisperer was created and contained in LIMBO for the safety of Lucifer’s family and his brother discovering the creations in his castle. More information to be shared in ~Notes~.

  -In LIMBO, the Whisperer tends to roam around the dimension, traveling around it once every 40 Time Ticks (24 Earth Hours), as if it was guarding the domain.

  -When introduced to an equine, the Whisperer doesn’t seem to acknowledge the presence of the mustang, however, on record, when a Shadow is [usually] forced into LIMBO, the Whisperer doesn’t hesitate to shred the smoke from its tail when it does it’s Timely wander and catches the Shadow.
