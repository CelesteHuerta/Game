<!--Always. Have. Hope… Hope… I constantly look over my captures and study their nervous system, their skeletal system, their digestive system, everything! The griffons and reptiles... the manticores and dragons... Failures. The brain can stimulate waves up to twelve minutes after death, afterwards, there is no chance to recharge the neurons... At first, I saw that removing the brain and brain stem from the skull would be best, but I overestimated my abilities to dissect and operate. Twelve minutes. I'm not fast enough… but why would I be? Afterall, operating and removing vital organs and tissue is an art, not just a guilty pleasure. Overtime, I discovered that decapitation is the quickest way to remove a head and attach it to the body. I thought I always worked fast... Not fast enough, this is inefficient! These experiments are not right! -->
