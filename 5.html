<!--Maybe, I will find a way to preserve her, keep her beside me... But the thought of cutting her open and replacing her insides with all sorts of organs from separate entities! It thrills me! I cannot express the joy that crosses my mind when I picture her body on the metal table, fur flawless ready to be ruined by her crimson essences. I could hardly wait for that day to come. My brother, Universum, doesn’t yet know of the experiments I have begun many moons ago, but each time I discuss my discoveries with Universum. He pays no mind to them, cares not about my discoveries, and even worse, congratulates me... congratulates me for slaughter. For my inner insanity and desire to mutilate and corrupt the souls of the innocent. Dearest brother, you shouldn’t be proud of my twisted accomplishments. They only make me want to hurt more. -->
