<!--Log 16: My eldest companion, Mr. Ichabod Inanis Daemonium has helped me a great deal with, possibly, my greatest creation yet. I can never thank him enough for the sacrifice he had made for me. The ultimate sacrificeâ€¦ I have been able to create a being in which it can help instead of hinder those who come across it. Mr. Daemonium will forever greet new ponies with a smile and welcoming claw. Although sharp and intimidating, his personality has now become calm and gentle. Perfect for greeting children. Perfect for protecting those who had befriended him. Perfect for his host. If Vanth and I ever decide to conceive, then perhaps I would assign Mr. Daemonium to protect them. -->
