  -Mr. Long Legs appears to small children as imaginary friends and sworn to protect them from the many dangers that he was sworn to protect many, many millenniums prior.

-Much like his living unicorn counterpart, he is constantly smiling and giggling. However, unlike his living counterpart, Mr. Long Legs never speaks.

-Often confused with games that involve adults. Very violent in nightmares with the parents of children he defends.-->
